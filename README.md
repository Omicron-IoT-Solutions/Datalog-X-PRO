![DSC_0042](https://github.com/Omicron-IoT-Solutions/Datalog-X-PRO/assets/141452095/28735f14-6ce6-46a1-a905-5cb43679b0e3)

The internet of things (IoT) multisensor wireless device Datalog X-PRO is designed for remote monitoring of multiple processes requiring high safety and measurement precision. In support of your automation needs, it is fitted to receive up to 3 sensors of multiple types. 
The system is delivered with a rechargeable Li-Ion Battery, accessories needed to mount the Main Unit enclosure, its AC/DC adapter, and a wireless communication module. Remote data transmission may be performed by different popular wireless technologies. Customers are also offered memberships for the use of a platform for remote monitoring and configuration of the device, supported by the manufacturer.

The device is delivered with the necessary tools for its installation in the user's application. It may require initial configuration regarding its wireless communication configuration. After the first setup, additional configurations can be made remotely. 

The Datalog X-PRO has been thought to be easily implemented and to monitor and deliver data about the evolution of the processes it is in. For this, it relies on a series of parameters, functionalities, and tools; among these, it is worth highlighting the direct link that the devices have with the Centriomega® Remote Monitoring Platform through their wireless communication modules: a platform accessible from any computing device enabled for internet navigation (PC, tablet, smartphone).

Said platform enables remote device configuration and monitoring, shows real-time dashboards with the variables of interest, presents alarms with visual indications, sends external warning messages through email, SMS, and Telegram messages or via webhooks, keeps data registers for up to two years, and tracks corrective actions and comments taken when alarms have occurred.
